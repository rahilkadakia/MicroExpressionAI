# MicroExpressionAI

Micro Expressions are those involuntary muscular movements of the facial muscles produced in response to a stimulus. They are short-lived expressions that last for anywhere between 0.04 to 0.2 seconds and are extremely subtle in their amplitude. Given their fleeting and elusive nature, it becomes almost impossible to detect these expressions through the naked eye.

This project helps in running several TensorFlow models and evaluates their metrics.

On the basis of this project, we have published a Research Paper: [Comparative Analysis of Micro Expression Recognition using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9587731)

## How to run the project?

Step 1: Open Classification_Template.ipynb in Google Colab.

Step 2: Enable GPU from Notebook Settings.

Step 3: Import the suitable data in zip format and change the import criteria where needed.

Step 4: Run all cells. To note- the model in code is MobileNet.
